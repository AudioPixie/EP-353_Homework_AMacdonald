# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Splatoon Voice Generator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a wavetable synthesizer.")

My project is about creating a program that takes in a voice clip and applies effects to it to make it sound like voices from the video game Splatoon. Reference: [Splatoon voice clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJYM3NZm3Rk)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will take in a file and apply specific effects to it to achieve an approximation of what the voices sounds like in-game. These effects are as follows:

* Pitch/formant shifting
	* This will be the most difficult part to implement. I have done some research and haven't found a concrete example of how to do this that I understand yet, I will have some questions to see if this is a realistic goal.
* Filter with an LFO mapped to the cutoff
	* This was a topic covered in class so I will be able to use class materials as a starting point
* Flanger
	* This was a topic covered in class so I will be able to use class materials as a starting point


## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's project, which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

N/A

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And it is not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

* Program works and provides an altered audio file
* Filter/LFO and flanger work
* Some form of pitch shifting is attempted - if the end result is not what I was expecting/doesn't have the desired effect, I can work with that anyway and just make sure it sounds cool
* Program is user friendly

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

* Program works and provides an altered audio file
* Filter/LFO and flanger work
* Pitch shifting works as intended
* Program is user friendly/possibly has a simple UI to work in
* Outcome sounds close to the reference

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

* Program works and provides an altered audio file
* Filter/LFO and flanger work
* Pitch shifting works as intended
* Program has a UI
* Outcome is an excellent emulation of the reference
* Additional effect options are present (e.g. reverb)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I am going to start with the frequency/pitch shifting as that is going to be the most complicated part
