#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have gotten a highpass/lowpass filter working with an LFO mapped to the cutoff. I also have a separate script for a flanger effect.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not implemented the pitch shifting yet (I saw your notes from my proposal and have some questions on how to get running with soundpipe). I also haven't organized my scripts to work together yet, as they are just separate files.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have questions about soundpipe. For the filters, the highpass works fine but the lowpass seems to just be making the sound quieter, as opposed to actually cutting frequencies (although I need to double check with headphones). The flanger script from class works fine but it is very susceptible to clipping and I am going to try to fix that.
